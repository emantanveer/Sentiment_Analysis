# Sentiment Analysis using Tiny Llama and LoRA

This project demonstrates the fine-tuning of the Tiny Llama model for sentiment analysis using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technique. The model has been fine-tuned to classify text data into sentiment categories (positive or negative).

## Project Overview

This project uses the Tiny Llama model as a base and fine-tunes it using LoRA for sentiment analysis. LoRA helps to reduce the memory and computational cost of fine-tuning large models while maintaining performance. The model is capable of classifying text into different sentiment categories.

### Key Features:
- Fine-tuning Tiny Llama using LoRA for sentiment analysis.
- Easy inference for classifying sentiment in new text.
- Evaluation and performance metrics.
